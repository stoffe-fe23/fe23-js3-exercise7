# Ã–vningsuppgift 7, Javascript 3 - Kristoffer Bengtsson (FE23)
## Calculator (React + Redux)

Exercise in React and Redux: a very primitive calculator. 

Install dependencies with:
```
npm install
```

Start dev server with:
```
npm run dev
```

Or build the app with:
```
npm run build
```

(Note! If using VSCode LiveServer to test the build version: dist/index.html must be modified to change "/assets" to "./assets" in the link and script tags for the page to load properly.)
